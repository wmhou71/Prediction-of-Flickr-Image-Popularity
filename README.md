# Prediction-of-Flickr-Image-Popularity
  
此主題是由比賽主辦單位給予的數據集(dataset)，根據一些資料特性包含照片拍攝者、照片等資料，以Python透過API去Flickr挖掘有用的資訊，將既有資料先以皮爾森(Pearson)相關性分數來評估特性與熱門程度(popularity)的相關性後，再透過類神經網絡(Neural Network)建立預測模型，來預測其熱門程度(包含觀看數、喜歡數等)。  
   
This competition was about predicting the popularity of images in Flickr. The definition of popularity are differently defined by competitors' own. It might contain the quantity of view, like, comments,etc. The official gave us the datasets which mentioned about the ID of images and users. According to the data, we exploited Flickr API in Python to mine useful information. Then through Pearson's score, evaluate the correlation between features and the popularity of images. Build the predictive model via Nural Network to predict the images' popularity.
